# 👋 Hi there, I'm Gagan Gupta

I’m a **Backend Developer** with a focus on building scalable APIs, managing microservices, and creating systems that *don’t break under pressure*. I specialize in **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS**, with a growing love for distributed systems, clean architecture, and the occasional venture into **game development**—because sometimes solving logic bugs in a 2D platformer is just as satisfying as debugging microservices in production.
